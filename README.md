Write pseudocode and implement a Python program for the following problem.1. Read in: the name of an employee, followed by the number of hours worked by the employee (an integer that is guaranteed to be greater than 0), the pay rate of the employee (a float that is guaranteed to be greater than 0), and the tax rate (as a percentage) for the employee (again, a float that is guaranteed to be greater than 0).2. Compute the total pay for the employee by multiplying the pay rate and the number of hours worked. Store the total pay in an appropriately-named variable.3. Compute the tax withholding for the employee by multiplying the total pay by the tax rate divided by 100. Store the withholding in an appropriately-named variable.4. Compute the net pay for the employee by subtracting the witholding from the total pay. Store the net pay in an appropriately-named variable.5. Print the name of the employee, the number of hours worked, the pay rate, the total pay, the withholding, and the net pay
